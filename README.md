# 🏔️ Swiss Gold Engine | Market Optimization Terminal

A high-fidelity performance simulation engine built for Tier 1 market analysis (Switzerland, Germany, UK). This terminal visualizes conversion dynamics from top-of-funnel reach down to high-LTV FTD events.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Core Market Simulations**: Targeted logic for CH, DE, and UK baseline behaviors.
- **Wealth-Centric Audio Design**: Features a custom Web Audio API synthesizer generating deep, gold-resonant sound effects for "Luxurious" UX feedback.
- **Interactive Funnel Logic**: Stacked visual nodes allowing for granular conversion rate (CVR) optimization.
- **Intel Exporting**: Generate high-resolution PDF reports using `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Dark-mode glassmorphism interface with performance-first animations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 19 (TypeScript)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **Visuals**: Recharts (for velocity curves)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Audio**: Web Audio API (No external assets)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
